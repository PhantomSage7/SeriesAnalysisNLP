# SeriesAnalysisNLP
Series Analysis with NLP, NER, and LLM-Powered Chatbots

This project offers a comprehensive approach to analyzing your favorite series using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs). It encompasses data scraping, text classification, Named Entity Recognition (NER), theme extraction, and interactive chatbots. The culmination of this project is a web-based interface created with Gradio, integrating all these components into a seamless user experience. This project is designed to elevate your CV by equipping you with advanced NLP skills applicable in the industry.

## Overview

The project is organized into five distinct modules, each addressing a specific aspect of the analysis:

- crawler: Contains code for web scraping to build an extensive dataset about the series using Scrapy.

- character_network: Includes code for constructing a detailed character network through Spacy's Named Entity Recognition (NER), NetworkX for network analysis, and PyViz for visualization.

- text_classifier: Features code for training a text classifier capable of categorizing text into multiple classes.

- theme_classifier: Contains code for identifying and extracting the main themes of the series using zero-shot classifiers.

- character_chat_bot: Provides code for developing a character chatbot powered by LLMs, enabling interactive conversations with characters from the series.
